        teacher on her staff. Also, being the first daycare in the area. Over the daycare had expanded for her house to
        bigger spaces, and acquiring another
        location. Bonnie then decided to open a flower shop, then a balloon shop. She was responsible for establishing 4
        businesses, a entrepenuer

        the same exact land that the market today will be serving.

 	 The first feature you will see displayed is "Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)". This is displayed at the top below the header and reads "Countdown until opening day".

	A second feature you will see is "Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)".You will see this at the middle right where there is a weather application. When you click to see the weather it takes you to another page where after putting in the location, it will display the weather.

	A third feature you will see is "Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app". You will see this under the section that says "Pick a flower to plant". Upon clicking a button that says "click here" a random flower will pop up from a json lis.

		A fourth feature that you will see is "Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that itâ€™s being saved/persisted". This is displayed at the very bottom of the page where it says "Sign up". Upon doing this the email will be stored.

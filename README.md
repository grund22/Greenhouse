# Miss Bonnie's Greenhouse

## This project is a website dedicated to promoting Miss Bonnie's Greenhouse and Market. Miss Bonnie Travis is a Mt. Washington legend for her pioneering of female entrepenurship and business leadership. Her family is now following in her footsteps with opening a greenhouse and market on her land and recreating the garden she used to feed all those closest to her. 

1. The first feature you will see displayed is **"Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)".**   This is displayed at the top below the header banner and reads "Countdown until opening day". The way this was accomplished is by counting down to a specific date, May 5th 2022. After getting todays date, it updates the count down every 1 second. After it reaches said date it will than display "Expired".

2. A second feature you will see is **"Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)".** If you scroll down the page, you will see this towards bottom right titled **"Weather"** and there is a weather application. When you click to see the weather icon it takes you to another page (Weather.html). Once here you put in the location you like, it will display the weather. You can load 10+ weather cards, and view them at the same time. This is accomplished by accessing the the openweather api and fetching data. 

3. A third feature you will see is **"Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app".** You will see this under the section that says "Pick a flower to plant". Upon clicking a button that says "click here" a random flower will pop up from a json list. The Json list is one I have created with 20 different flowers.

4. A fourth feature you will see it **"Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file.**. This is located at the very bottom of the page. It has a button that says "Sign Up" and Create an account underneath that. When you put in your email address it than stores it in a text file that is sent to myself.

This was such a fun opportunity and learning experience that I appreciate and will use in my future.
